                                In the top right corner of the main window the status of HEAT is indicated.
                                The status determines whether you can use the interpreter subwindow.
                                HEAT ensures that the content of the editor subwindow and the definitions
                                you can use in the interpreter agree.
                                The status is one of the following three:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><img src="statusOK.jpg" width="70" height="27"><br> OK: 
                                        You can evaluate expressions in the interpreter console.<br>
                                        Either there is no program in the editor and you can just use pre-defined functions in the interpreter,
                                        or the program in the editor was successfully compiled and you can use its definitions.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><img src="statusUNKNOWN.jpg" width="70" height="27"><br> Change:
                                        You changed the program in the editor (possibly by opening a new one).<br>
                                        You cannot use the interpreter. You have to compile before you can use the
                                        interpreter.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><img src="statusFAIL.jpg" width="70" height="27"><br> Error:
                                        You compiled the program in the editor unsuccessfully.<br>
                                        The error message is shown in the console and the error location is
                                        highlighted in the editor.<br>
                                        You cannot use the interpreter. Instead you should modify the program in the editor.
                                    </li>
             
                                </ul>
