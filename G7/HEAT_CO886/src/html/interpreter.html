        HEAT uses a Haskell interpreter that you have to install separately.
        Currently HEAT works only with the Glasgow Haskell Compiler Interpreter (ghci).
        It has been tested with ghc version 7.0.3. We advise you to
        install the Haskell Platform, which includes ghci and many libraries
        that you might want to use as well.
        <br><br>
        HEAT needs to know the full path of the ghci exectuable. The first time
        you start HEAT, it will ask you for that path. 
        <br><br>
        Under the menu item Options you can later change that path and also set
        further command-line-options and an additional search path for libraries.
        <br><br>
        By default ghci will search for imported modules amongst the
        installed libraries and the directory of the importing module.
