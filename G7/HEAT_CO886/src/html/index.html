    <td>HEAT is a simple Integrated Development Environment for Haskell programs.<br><br>
      HEAT uses a Haskell interpreter that you installed separately.
      HEAT enables you to edit Haskell programs, evaluate expressions in the interpreter,
      and check all properties in your programs.
      <br><br>
      The HEAT window has a toolbar at the top, which provides quick access to
      most functionality that is also available from the menus.
      Below, the window is split into three parts: an editor subwindow, 
      a console subwindow in which you use the Haskell interpreter, and an 
      overview window that lists entities such as functions and types, which 
      you defined in your program shown in the editor. Clicking on an overview item
      finds and highlights the entity in the editor.
