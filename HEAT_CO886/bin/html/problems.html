        All top-level functions and constants (except properties) are expected to
        have their type declared as well. Otherwise they will not appear in the
        overview subwindow.
        <br><br>
        HEAT does not work with literate Haskell programs (<code>.lhs</code>).
        The definitions of all entities collected in the overview subwindow must start
        in the first column; e.g. locally defined class methods are not found.
        <br><br>
        All HEAT settings that you can change under the menu item Options are
        saved in a file <code>heat.settings</code> that is located in your home
        directory. You can always delete that file to reset HEAT to its original
        settings (So it will ask you for the path of the Haskell interpreter again.).
        <br><br>
        HEAT also records some of its activities in a file <code>heat.log</code>. If HEAT
        crashes or shows faulty behaviour, the content of this readable file may give some
        indication of the cause.
        <br><br>
        HEAT, including its source code is available freely from
        <code>http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/heat/</code>.
        You are welcome to contribute to improvements.
        <br><br>
        Please report bugs in HEAT with clear descriptions to <code>oc@kent.ac.uk</code>.
